## What is Create VisActor App

Create VisActor App is a CLI tool that helps you quickly create web applications with the [VisActor](https://visactor.io) library. In other words, it provides boilerplates for integrating frontend frameworks with the VisActor library.

We support the following frontend frameworks:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- More coming soon...

The VisActor libraries we support are:

- [VChart](https://visactor.io/vchart)
- [VTable](https://visactor.io/vtable) (WIP)
